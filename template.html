    Load a minimized copy of adsafe.js from your domain. You can combine
    it with other js files to minimize HTTP transactions.

<script src="http://www.yourTrustedDomain.../adsafe.js"></script>

    The widget is given a name that is all uppercase with a trailing
    underbar. That name is used with ADSAFE.id and ADSAFE.go. It is
    also used a prefix on the IDs of HTML elements in the widget.

    The widget starts with a div with the widget ID. All of the widget's
    material must be inside of the div.

<div id="TEMPLATE_">

    HTML markup required by the widget goes here.

    ADSAFE.id is used to inform ADsafe about the widget. Use of ADSAFE.id
    is required only if the widget will load library modules.

<script>
ADSAFE.id("TEMPLATE_");
</script>

    If library modules are required for the widget, load them here.

<script src="template.js"></script>

    ADSAFE.go starts the execution of the widget.

<script>
ADSAFE.go("TEMPLATE_", function (dom, lib) {
    "use strict";

// This is where the code for the widget is placed. It can access
// the document through the dom parameter, allowing it indirect
// access to html elements, allowing it to change content, styling,
// and behavior.

// Each library file can give itself a NAME. This program can access
// the library file as lib.NAME.

});
</script>

    The is the end of the widget.

</div>

    Material that is outside of the div cannot be accessed by the widget.
